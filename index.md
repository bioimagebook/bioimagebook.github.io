This book tries explain the main ideas of image analysis in a practical and engaging way.

It's written primarily for busy biologists who need to analyze images as part of their work -- but I hope others might find it useful as well.

The core content is based on my earlier handbook *{notranslate}`Analyzing fluorescence microscopy images with ImageJ`* ([PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260261544_Analyzing_fluorescence_microscopy_images_with_ImageJ), [GitBook](https://petebankhead.gitbooks.io/imagej-intro/)).
This has been extensively revised, generalized and expanded; the new title reflects the fact that it's no longer entirely focussed on fluorescence images, nor on ImageJ -- although both still play a big role.

The biggest change is that it now exists as an open [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).
This makes the whole thing more maintainable for me, and interactive for anyone who reads it.

It's a work in progress, and probably always will be, but I hope you find it useful.
