"Microscopy images normally look blurry because light originating from one"
" point in the sample is not all detected at a single pixel: usually it is"
" detected over several pixels and _z_-slices. This is _not_ simply "
"because we cannot use perfect lenses; rather, it's caused by a "
"fundamental limit imposed by the nature of light. The end result is as if"

" choose the size and shapes of filters ourselves, changing them "

"in at least two important ways. Firstly, it's effectively applied to our "
"data _before_ noise gets involved, so offers no noise-reduction benefits."
" Secondly, because it occurs before we ever set our eyes on our images, "

"It should be kept in mind that the use of $r_{airy}$ and $z_{min}$ in the"

"brightness differences, finite pixel sizes and noise further complicate "
"the situation, so that in practice a greater distance may well be "

"Knowing that the Airy disk resembles a Gaussian function is extremely "

"it. The parameters of the function will then tell us the Gaussian's "
"center exactly, which corresponds to where the fluorescing structure "
"really is -- admittedly not with complete accuracy, but potentially still"
" beyond the accuracy of even the pixel size (noise is the real "
"limitation). This idea is fundamental to single-molecule localization "
