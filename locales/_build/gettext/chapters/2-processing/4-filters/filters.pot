msgid "Filters are phenomenally useful. Almost all interesting image analysis involves filtering in some way at some stage. In fact, the analysis of a difficult image can sometimes become (almost) trivial once a suitable filter has been applied to it. It's therefore no surprise that much of the image processing literature is devoted to the topic of designing and testing filters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/4-filters/filters.md:50
msgid "The basic idea of filtering here is that each pixel in an image is assigned a new value depending upon the values of other pixels within some defined region (the pixel's **neighborhood**). Different filters work by applying different calculations to the neighborhood to get their output. Although the plethora of available filters can be intimidating at first, knowing only a few of the most useful filters is already a huge advantage."

To filter an image, we center the kernel over each pixel of the input image.
