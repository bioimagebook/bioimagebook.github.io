msgid "Point operations are straightforward: they depend only on individual pixels, so the number of dimensions is unimportant. Image arithmetic involving a 3D stack and a 2D image can also be carried out in ImageJ using the {menuselection}`Process --> Image Calculator`, where the operation involving the 2D image is applied to each slice of the 3D stack in turn. Other options, such as filtering and thresholding, are possible, but bring with them extra considerations -- and often significantly higher computational costs."

msgid "Setting the LUT of a 3D image requires particular care. The normal {menuselection}`Brightness/Contrast...` tool only takes the currently-displayed slice into consideration when pressing {guilabel}`Reset` or {guilabel}`Auto`. Optimizing the display for a single slice does not necessarily mean the rest of the stack will look reasonable if the brightness changes much. {menuselection}`Process --> Enhance Contrast...` is a better choice, since here you can specify that the information in the entire stack should be used. You can also specify the percentage of pixels that should be saturated (clipped) _for display_, i.e. those that should be shown with the first or last colors in the LUT. So long as {guilabel}`Normalize` and {guilabel}`Equalize histogram` are not selected, the pixel values shouldn't be changed."

msgid "If the percentage of saturated pixels is 0, then the minimum and maximum pixel values throughout the image will be given the first and last LUT colors respectively, with all other colors devoted to values in between. This is sensitive to outliers, and often results in images that have poor contrast. It's usually better to accept some small amount of visual saturation, in order to give more LUT colors to the pixel values between the extremes."

But for a __z__-stack, the spacing between slices is usually larger than the width and height of a pixel. And if the third dimension is time, then it uses another scale entirely. Therefore more thought usually needs to be given to what sizes make most sense."

In some circumstances, these choices can have a very large impact upon the result."

msgid "_z-Stacks_ – It is normally a good idea to use the stack histogram with __z__-stacks. If you do not, then your threshold will be affected by whatever slice you happen to be viewing at the time of thresholding – introducing a potentially weird source of variability in the results. It is probably _not_ a good idea to calculate a new threshold for each slice, because this would lead to at least _something_ being detected on every slice. But in the outer slices there may well only be blur and noise – in which case nothing _should_ be detected!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/imagej.md:176
msgid "_Time series_ – In a time series, bleaching can sometimes cause the image to darken over time. In such a case, using the stack histogram might cause fewer pixels to exceed the threshold at later time points simply for this reason, and recalculating the threshold for each image may be better. On the other hand, if images were previously normalized somehow to compensate for bleaching [^fn_1], then the stack threshold might be preferable again. It's tricky."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/7-multidimensional_processing/imagej.md:184
msgid "There is one other implementation issue that needs attention. When {guilabel}`Dark Background` is checked and an automated threshold is computed, then it is only really the low threshold that matters – the high threshold is always set to the maximum in the histogram to ensure that all brighter pixels are designated 'foreground' in the result. However, if not using {guilabel}`Stack Histogram`, then for non-8-bit images the histograms are calculated using the minimum and maximum pixels on the slice, and consequently the high threshold cannot be higher than this maximum value (look at how the high threshold value changes in {menuselection}`Mitosis` as you compute auto thresholds for different slices). This means that any brighter pixels will be _outside_ the threshold range (and therefore 'background') if they occur on a different slice. This can cause holes to appear in the brightest parts of structures, and is probably not what you want. A similar situation occurs with the low threshold when {guilabel}`Dark Background` is unchecked."

The latter can happily handle 3D images, but only by creating and measuring 2D ROIs independently on each slice. Alternatively, {menuselection}`Image --> Stacks --> Plot Z-axis Profile` is like applying {menuselection}`Measure` to each slice independently, making measurements either over the entire image or any ROI. It will also plot the mean pixel values, but even if you do not particularly want this the command can still be useful.
