This is necessary to look into thick samples without getting lost in the haze of other planes. **Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM)** achieves this by only concentrating on detecting light for one pixel at any time, and using a pinhole to try to only allow light from a corresponding point in the sample to be detected."

msgid "Because at most only one pixel is being recorded at any given moment, it does not make sense to illuminate the entire sample at once, which could do unnecessary damage. Rather, a laser illuminates only a small volume. If this would be made small enough, then a pinhole would not actually be needed because we would know that all emitted light _must_ be coming from the illuminated spot; however, the illumination itself is like an hour-glass PSF in the specimen. The pinhole is needed to make sure only the light from the central part reaches the detector. This then causes the final PSF, as it appears _in the image_, to take on more of a rugby-ball (or American football) appearance."

Compared to widefield microscopy, LSCM provide a significant improvement in what can be seen along the *z*-dimension, although the *xy* resolution is not very different. Also, because single pixels are recorded separately, the image can (potentially) be more or less any size and shape -- rather than limited by the pixel count on a camera."

msgid "However, these advantages comes with a major drawback. Images usually contain thousands to millions of pixels, and so only a tiny fraction of the time required to record an image is spent detecting photons for any one pixel in a LSCM image -- unlike in the widefield case, where photons can be detected for all pixels over the entire image acquisition time. This can cause LSCM image acquisition to be comparatively slow, noisy (in terms of few detected photons) or both. Spatial information is therefore gained at a cost in noise and/or temporal resolution."

msgid "As described in {ref}`chap_formation_spatial`, the vast majority of the light from the in-focus plane falls within the Airy disk. Using a pinhole smaller than this can result in so little light being detected that the image becomes too noisy to be useful. On the other hand, increasing the size of the pinhole will result in some more of the remaining light located in the outer rings of the Airy pattern, but _most_ extra photons will come from out-of-focus planes. This causes a reduction in the effectiveness of the optical sectioning. Therefore, a pinhole diameter of approximately 1 Airy disk provides a reasonable balance between detecting most of the in-focus light and achieving good optical sectioning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/3-fluorescence/4-microscope_types/microscope_types.md:146
msgid "Nevertheless, sometimes a reduction in optical sectioning is a worthwhile cost -- such as when photons are very scarce, and some extra background is tolerable. Also, when recording a multichannel image then you may well have to set the pinhole size according to the Airy disk for one channel. But because the size of the disk depends upon the light wavelength (as described in Equation {eq}`eqn-res_lateral`), the pinhole diameter will differ in terms of Airy disk sizes for other channels."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/3-fluorescence/4-microscope_types/microscope_types.md:160
msgid "**Spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM)** implements one such compromise by using a large number of pinholes punched into a disk, so that the fluorophores can be excited and light detected for many different _non-adjacent_ pixels simultaneously. By not trying to record adjacent pixels at the same time, pinholes can be used to block _most_ of the out-of-focus light for each pixel, since this originates close to the region of interest for that pixel (i.e. the PSF becomes very dim at locations far away from its center) -- but sufficiently-spaced pixels can still be recorded simultaneously with little influence on one another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/3-fluorescence/4-microscope_types/microscope_types.md:163
msgid "In practice, spinning disk confocal microscopy images are likely to be less sharp than laser scanning confocal images because some light does scatter through other pinholes. Also, the pinhole sizes cannot be adjusted to fine-tune the balance between noise and optical sectioning. However, the optical sectioning offered by SDCM is at least a considerable improvement over the widefield case, and an acceptable SNR can be achieved with much faster frame-rates using SDCM as opposed to LSCM."

The main idea of **multiphoton microscopy** is that fluorophore excitation requires the _simultaneous absorption of multiple photons_, rather than only a single photon. The excitation light has a longer wavelength than would otherwise be required to cause molecular excitation with a single photon, but the energies of the multiple photons combine to cause the excitation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/3-fluorescence/4-microscope_types/microscope_types.md:172
msgid "The benefit of this is that the multiphoton excitation only occurs at the focal region of the excitation -- elsewhere within the 'specimen PSF' the light intensities are insufficient to produce the 'multiphoton effect' and raise the fluorophores into an excited state. This means that the region of the specimen emitting photons at any one time is much smaller than when using single photon excitation (as in LSCM), and also less damage is being caused to the sample outside of the sample plane. Furthermore, multiphoton microscopy is able to penetrate deeper into a specimen -- up to several hundred µm."

Very briefly, TIRF microscopy involves using an illumination angled so that the change in refractive index encountered by the light as it approaches the specimen causes a further change in angle sufficient to prevent the light from directly entering the specimen (i.e. it is 'totally internally reflected'). Nevertheless, fluorophores can still be excited by an evanescent wave that is produced when this occurs. This wave decays exponentially, so that only fluorophores right at the surface are excited -- meaning fluorophores deeper within the specimen do not interfere with the recording."

The basic principle is this: a photon strikes a photocathode, hopefully producing an electron. When this occurs, the electron is accelerated towards a dynode, and any produced electrons accelerated towards further dynodes. By adjusting the 'gain', the acceleration of the electrons towards successive dynodes can be varied; higher accelerations mean there is an increased likelihood that the collision of the electrons with the dynode will produce a higher number of electrons moving into the next stage. The charge of the electrons is then quantified at the end ({numref}`fig-pmt`). Because the (possibly very small) number of original detected photons have now been amplified to a (possibly much) larger number electrons by the successive collisions with dynodes, the effect of read noise is usually minor for a PMT."

In this case, the electrons from 4 (i.e. 2×2) pixels of the CCD are added together before being quantified: the electron clouds are approximately 4 times bigger relative to the read noise ({numref}`fig-ccd_binning`), and readout can be faster because fewer electron clouds need to be quantified. The obvious disadvantage of this is that one cannot then put the electrons from the 4 pixels 'back where they belong'. As a result, the binned measurement is simply treated as a single (bigger) pixel. The recorded image contains 25% of the pixels in the unbinned image, while still covering the same field of view, so spatial information is lost. Larger bins may also be used, with a correspondingly more dramatic impact upon image size ({numref}`fig-ccd_binning`D)."

Here, the electrons are first passed through an additional 'gain register' before quantification. At every stage of this gain register, each electron has a small probability -- perhaps only 1% -- of being amplified (through 'impact ionisation') and giving rise to two electrons entering the next stage.

On the other hand, filtering has the advantage of giving you an image that is exactly the same size as the original. This is like getting all four possible binned images for the price of one (i.e. all four different ways to split the image into 2×2 pixel blocks, instead of just one way), so less spatial information is lost. With filtering you also have much more flexibility: you might choose a 3×3 filter instead, or a Gaussian filter, or a range of different filtering options to see which is best.

Sometimes this extra noise is too high a cost for the flexibility of filtering, and binning is better. (In this regard, remember that read noise is typically worse for CCD cameras, but not such a problem for EMCCDs or PMTs.)"
