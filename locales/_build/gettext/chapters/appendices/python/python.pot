msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/appendices/python/python.md:46
msgid "Comments are explanations added to code that help explain what is going on. They aren't essential for the code to *run*, but often are essential to make sense of it. It's a very good idea to add comments to your own code - either for others to read, or for yourself in the future."

msgid "When programming, you'll likely use variables all the time for different purposes and to represent different things. The type of the variable will determine what you can do with it. Some examples are given below."

msgid "The order is important: the variable being set is on the left and the value it is being set to is on the right. Switching the order can give an error - or a result you might not expect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/appendices/python/python.md:120
msgid "If you want to test if a variable is equal to something, you need to use `==` instead. The output of that will be either `True` or `False`."

msgid "In Python, both single and double quotation marks can be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/appendices/python/python.md:162
msgid "You can then do things like add strings together using the `+` symbol, which has the effect of concatenating them to create a new string."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/appendices/python/python.md:171
msgid "It doesn't *usually* matter whether you use single or double quotes, but it can matter if you want to include the other kind of quotation mark *within* the string."

msgid "In the example above, the `'` within 'wouldn't' was misinterpreted as the end of the string, and an error is the result."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/appendices/python/python.md:197
msgid "One way to get around that is to define the string using *3* double quotation marks `\"\"\"`."
