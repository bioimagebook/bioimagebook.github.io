msgid "This slightly murky philosophical distinction is considered in Alvy Ray Smith's technical memo (_right_), the title of which gives a good impression of the central argument. In short, pushing the pixels-are-square model too far leads to confusion in the end (e.g. what would happen at their 'edges'?), and does not really match up to the realities of how images are recorded (i.e. pixel values are not determined by detecting light emitted from little square regions, see {ref}`chap_formation_spatial`). Alternative terms, such as _sampling distance_, are often used instead of pixel size -- and are potentially less misleading."

For example, if we measure some structure horizontally in the image and find that it is 10 pixels in length, with a pixel size of 0.5µm, we can deduce that its actual length in reality is (approximately!) 10 × 0.5µm = 5µm."

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/pixel_size.md:173
msgid "This conversion is often done within the analysis software, but depends upon the pixel size information being present and correct. All being well, appropriate pixel sizes will have been written into an image file during acquisition and subsequently read by the software. Unfortunately, this does not always work out (see {ref}`chap_files`) and so we do always need to check our pixel sizes, and derived measurements of size, for reasonableness."
