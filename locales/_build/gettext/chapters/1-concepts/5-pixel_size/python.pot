#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:31
msgid "Checking the pixel size in Python has been, in my opinion, a bit of a pain - because the common libraries used to read images don't always make that information very easy to access."

msgid "The following code shows how we can read both the pixel values and the metadata."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:62
msgid "The metadata contains a lot of info, even including lookup tables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:64
msgid "Printing it a little more nicely (and skipping the LUTs), we get:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:72
msgid "This metadata is actually quite ImageJ-specific, and other TIFFs may give quite different metadata."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:74
msgid "We can see the version of ImageJ that wrote the file, but picking out the key thing we want here - the pixel size - is not so easy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:76
msgid "Seeing `unit=um` is encouraging, but not enough."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:78
msgid "We can explore a bit more with 'properties', which imageio described as ['a curated set of standardized metadata'](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/v2.30.0/reference/userapi.html#metadata)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:85
msgid "Here, the `spacing=(6.25, 6.25)` seems promising."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:87
msgid "It's tempting to suppose that means the pixel width and height are both 6.25 µm - *however* if I check the same image in ImageJ itself, I see the pixel width and height are actually 0.16 µm... which happens to equal 1.0/6.25 µm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:93
msgid "Therefore the information **is** in the metadata, but it's very easy to misinterpret - and it isn't even guaranteed to be correct if the image was written by some other software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:95
msgid "So while `imageio` is excellent for reading images easily - generally just a quick `im = imread(path)` - it's not necessarily the best thing to use when pixel sizes (or other metadata) matter."

msgid "Using BioIO"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:101
msgid "The best alternative I know for working with scientific (especially biomedical) images is [**BioIO**](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio) (the successor to [AICSImageIO](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio)). This is a really useful Python library that standardizes reading and writing multiple file formats - and, depending upon how it's installed, can even access lots more awkward proprietary file formats with the help of [Bio-Formats](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:104
msgid "Although it's possible to use a version of `imread` with BioIO, it's worth learning the alternative way of doing things by creating an `BioImage` object. This provides us with a way to access pixels and lots of other useful things whenever we need them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:120
msgid "From this, we can immediately see the attribute that will provide us with pixel sizes directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:126
msgid "One perhaps non-obvious thing to know when using BioIO is that the `BioImage` isn't a regular NumPy array of the kind that `imageio.imread` would return. Rather, if you want that, you need to request the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:129
msgid "Using this knowledge, we can check that we have the same mean pixel value for both - as a quick way to ascertain that the actual pixel values are likely to match."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:140
msgid "We've seen how two different libraries can enable us to read the same pixel values as NumPy arrays and extract pixel size information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:142
msgid "We might well expect that the NumPy arrays representing the pixel values are the same, but in fact we can't count on that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:144
msgid "NumPy is incredibly flexible when it comes to handling multidimensional arrays.  And while that flexibility can be really helpful, it can also complicate things."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:147
msgid "To see it in action, let's check the dimensions of the images we read using imageio and BioIO."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:164
msgid "We can see the number of pixels are the same, but there are some extra 'singleton' dimensions stuck into the results from BioIO (i.e. with length `1`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:166
msgid "Fortunately, we can easily remove them with an `np.squeeze` - and end up with the same arrays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:175
msgid "So a natural question is: **why has BioIO snuck in some extra dimensions?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:177
msgid "Before answering that, we should ask ourselves something else. **What exactly do we _have_ along the dimension of length `5`?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:180
msgid "And this is where things aren't terribly clear with imageio."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:182
msgid "`5` *could* be the width of the image, height of the image, number of channels, number of z-slices, or number of timepoints."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:184
msgid "Based upon our knowledge of images and the other dimensions, we'd be justified in expecting that the `5` doesn't correspond to the image width or height - `512` seems more likely for those - so it's probably one of the others."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:186
msgid "But the problem is that **we have no way of knowing** without further information. If we don't have some external source to tell us, we need to poke around the metadata or look at the contents to figure out the answer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:199
msgid "To me, that looks very much like we have 5 different channels. I'm making some assumptions there... but they seem pretty safe assumptions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:202
msgid "However BioIO removes this ambiguity in a couple of ways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:203
msgid "You can expect `BioIO` to return a 5D array, with the dimensions in a consistent order: `TCZYX` (although there is at least one caveat in the next section!)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:204
msgid "You can easily query the dimensions and order to be sure"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:213
msgid "Where are my channels?!?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:215
msgid "We've seen above that imageio can return a 5-channel image with the channels first. Our question here is: does it always do that?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:218
msgid "The answer, alas, is no. The location of the channels dimensions is painfully uncertain in Python, and often different tools expect it to be in different places."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:221
msgid "Or sometimes the *same* tool might put it in a different place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:223
msgid "To see that in action, let's read a simple RGB image with imageio."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:231
msgid "An RGB image has 3 channels - red, green and blue - but it seems that suddenly we have the channels dimension last."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:233
msgid "Why?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:235
msgid "I don't have a very satisfying explanation, except to say that for RGB that's often what you want because matplotlib expects the channels to be last, and we often use matplotlib to show images."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:247
msgid "It's not *always* what you want though, and if you get enough deep learning then you'll find the 'channels-first' or 'channels-last' question coming up often."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:249
msgid "With that in mind, we can use NumPy to shift from so-called 'channels-last' to 'channels-first' - but matplotlib won't like that very much."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:264
msgid "So imageio might get channels at the start or the end. For RGB, it seems to prefer the end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:267
msgid "What does BioIO do?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:269
msgid "Since I said BioIO is consistent, I'd like to say it puts the channels in the same place for the RGB and 5-channel image... but no. It also treats RGB as a special case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:279
msgid "It's a little hard to find, but the BioIO documentation mentions that [you can expect 5 dimensions for non-RGB images, but RGB images have 6 dimensions](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/bioio.html#bioio.bio_image.BioImage.get_image_data) - where the sixth is called `S` for `Samples`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:281
msgid "The good thing is that, assuming you don't have anything else going on with the first 3 dimensions - i.e. they are just `(1, 1, 1)` - a simple `np.squeeze` is enough to convert the pixel array into a matplotlib-friendly channels-last RGB format."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:285
msgid "More dimensions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:287
msgid "We'll end this section by looking at an image with 2 channels and 25 z-slices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:289
msgid "Since you now know how to explore the dimensions in detail, I'll use my `load_image` helper function for convenience... which returns a NumPy array that's pre-squeezed to remove any singleton dimensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:296
msgid "Since we already considered how to view multichannel images in the last chapter, let's extract a single channel here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:305
msgid "At this point, NumPy becomes quite fun - because it is *so easy* to do stuff along different dimensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:307
msgid "For example, we can rapidly generate different z-projections."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:335
msgid "But we're not limited to projecting along z - we can just switch the `axis` value and project along some other dimension."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:337
msgid "Note that this won't do any correction for differences in pixel size in xy vs. z. With only 25 z-slices, these projections look extremely squashed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/5-pixel_size/python.md:365
msgid "And we can also slice wherever we like as well, to obtain orthogonal views."
msgstr ""
