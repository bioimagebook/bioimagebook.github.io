msgid "Perhaps surprisingly, they are determined from the {guilabel}`Minimum` and {guilabel}`Maximum` in the current *Brightness/Contrast...* settings: the *Minimum* is subtracted, and the result is divided by *Maximum* - *Minimum*.

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/3-bit_depths/imagej.md:228
msgid "With scaling but without subtraction, it would make sense to divide all pixel values by the maximum in the image divided by the maximum in the new bit depth, i.e. by 5000/255. This would then lead to an image in which pixels fall into the range 204–255. Much information has clearly been lost: 1000 potentially different values have now been squeezed into 52."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/3-bit_depths/imagej.md:231
msgid "However, if we first subtract the smallest of our 16-bit values (i.e. 4000), our initial range becomes 0–1000.
