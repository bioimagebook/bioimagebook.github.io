msgid "Created by **Wayne Rasband** at the National Institutes of Health, ImageJ has become indispensable to the research community over more than 20 years. It continues to be updated regularly and is by far the most discussed topic on the [Scientific Community Image Forum](https://forum.image.sc) -- with [more than 10,000 topics](https://forum.image.sc/tags) at the time of writing, and more added every day."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/1-images_and_pixels/imagej.md:35
msgid "ImageJ's success is due not only to the features of the software itself, but to its openness and extensibility. The source code is in the public domain, meaning that others can adapt it as needed. But usually this isn't necessary, because users can write (and share) custom macros, plugins or scripts to add new functionality -- without changing ImageJ itself."

msgid "I personally have found ImageJ phenomenally useful throughout my career, to the extent that I am convinced that *anyone* working with biomedical images benefits if they know how to use it. Even if you ultimately use other software for your analysis, or even write your own, the ability to quickly check things in ImageJ is extremely helpful."
