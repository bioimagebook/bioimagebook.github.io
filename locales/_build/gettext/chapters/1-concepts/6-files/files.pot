Guesses need to be made about how to fill in the extra information properly (which is the problem of **interpolation**), and the result generally looks less sharp than the original. But if you double the size of a vector image, it's just a matter of updating the maths needed to draw the image accordingly, and the result looks just as sharp as the original."

msgid "Vector images are therefore best for things like diagrams, histograms, plots and charts, because they can be resized freely and still look good. Also, they often have tiny file sizes because only a few instructions to redraw the image need to be kept, whereas a huge number of pixels might be required to store sufficiently nice, sharp text in a bitmap. But bitmaps are needed for images formed from detecting light, which cannot be reduced to a few simple equations and instructions."
