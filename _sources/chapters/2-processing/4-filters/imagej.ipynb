    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the filters we've considered are available through the {menuselection}`Process --> Filters` submenu.\n",
    "This section adds a little more information about their implementation in ImageJ, and asks a few questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear filters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean filters\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to apply a 3×3 mean filter in ImageJ is through the {menuselection}`Process --> Smooth` command.\n",
    "The fact that the shortcut is {kbd}`Shift + S` can almost make this *too* easy, as I find myself accidentally smoothing when I really wanted to save my image.\n",
    "Take care.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply larger mean filters, the command is {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Mean...`.\n",
    "It uses approximately circular neighborhoods, and the neighborhood size is adjusted by choosing a {guilabel}`Radius` value.\n",
    "The {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Show Circular Masks` command displays the neighborhoods used for different values of {guilabel}`Radius`.\n",
    "If you happen to choose *Radius = 1*, you get a 3×3 filter -- and the same results as using {menuselection}`Smooth`.\n",

    "### Gaussian filters\n",
    "\n",
    "{menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Gaussian Blur...` is the command that implements a Gaussian filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that you want a Gaussian filter that isn't isotropic (i.e. has a different size along different dimensions), {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Gaussian Blur 3D...` can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not *really* recommended, unsharp masking is available through {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Unsharp mask...`.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Difference of Gaussians\n",
    "There's currently no direct command in ImageJ to implement difference of Gaussians filtering, rather the steps need to be pieced together with image duplication and subtraction.\n",
    "However {ref}`chap_macro_dog` describes how to generate a macro for DoG filtering.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom linear filters\n",
    "\n",
    "{menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Convolve...` makes it possible to define any custom linear filter by entering the values of the desired coefficients, separated by spaces and arranged in rows and columns.\n",
    "If you {guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is selected, then the coefficients are scaled so that they add to 1, by dividing by the sum of all the coefficients -- unless the sum is 0, in which case requesting normalizion does nothing.\n",

    "The results of convolving with a single -1 coefficient in different circumstances:\n",
    "1.  _{guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is checked_: Nothing at all happens. The normalization makes the filter just a single 1... and convolving with a single 1 leaves the image unchanged.\n",
    "2.  _You have a 32-bit image ({guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` unchecked)_: The pixel values become negative, and the image looks inverted.\n",
    "3.  _You have an 8-bit image ({guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` unchecked)_: The pixel values would become negative, but then cannot be stored in an 8-bit unsigned integer form. Therefore, all pixels simply become clipped to zero.\n",
