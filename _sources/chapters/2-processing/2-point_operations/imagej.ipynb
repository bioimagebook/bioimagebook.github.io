    "### Duplicating images\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important ImageJ shortcuts to learn is {kbd}`Shift + D` to **duplicate the image**.\n",
    "This applies the command {menuselection}`Image --> Duplicate...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to quickly duplicate an image matters for two main reasons:\n",
    "1. We often want to process duplicates of an image in different ways, and then combine or compare the results.\n",
    "2. Mistakes happen, and {menuselection}`Edit --> Undo` is rather limited; it can undo *some* processing steps applied to a single image slice, but not always... and it can't undo operations applied to image stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with an image in ImageJ, I almost always have at least one duplicate lingering around for when when things inevitably go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "But {menuselection}`Image --> Duplicate...` has an extra, hidden bonus: it's supports extracting just a part of the image.\n",
    "This is controlled both by any ROI and by selecting subsets of channels, z-slices or time points where relevant.\n",
    "I frequently use duplication as a way to extract the channel from an image, as a more convenient alternative to {menuselection}`Image --> Color --> Split Channels`.\n",

    ":::{admonition} Why can't ImageJ's 'Undo' undo much?\n",
    "Implementing 'undo' in software is quite tricky.\n",
    "Especially in flexible software that enables the user to do a lot of different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to image processing, undo effectively requires the software to quietly duplicate the pixel values of an image before any processing step, so that they can be recovered later if needed.\n",
    "For a small image, that can work fine.\n",
    "But for big images (say, 1 GB or more), duplicating that much data could *significantly* slow down the software and potentially result in lots of out-of-memory errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageJ provides some very limited undo support for 2D slices, but it's best not to rely on it.\n",
    "In general, it's left up to the user to decide when duplicating is necessary.\n",
    "If you suspect you might regret a processing step, then it's best to always duplicate the image beforehand with {kbd}`Shift + D`.\n",

    "\n",

    "I only know about this sneaky alternative option through the [ImageJ release notes](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/notes.html).\n",

    "For 32-bit image inversion, the pixels are subtracted from the *display maximum*, i.e. whatever maximum is set in the {menuselection}`Image --> Adjust --> Brightness/Contrast...` dialog box.\n",
